# My Data Analytics Portfolio Projects

## 1. [Covid-19 Deaths and Vaccinations SQL Data Exploration](https://github.com/hazelapondi/Data-Analytics-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/covid_deaths_and_vaccinations.sql)

![Covid-19 across the globe](https://github.com/hazelapondi/Data-Analytics-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/img/covid.png)

I used SQL for Data Exploration of the Covid-19 Deaths and Vaccinations from a data set obtained from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths "Coronavirus"). After downloading the data set, I transformed it. The data captures confirmed deaths from Covid-19 from Jan 2021. 

I explored covid cases, deaths and vaccinations to learn more about statistics such as the global & regional death and infection percentages, the population vs number of people vaccinated among others.

## 2. [Maji Ndogo Querying Data with SQL](https://github.com/hazelapondi/Data-Analytics-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/maji_ndogo.sql)

![People queueing for water in Maji Ndogo - 42 Amani Loop, Sokoto](https://github.com/hazelapondi/Data-Analytics-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/img/maji_ndogo.PNG)

Maji Ndogo is a fictitious country facing a water access issue in a number of its provinces. Using SQL I was able to draw insights on areas with very long queues, gender dynamics in queues (with the composition consisting of children, women and men) and  findings on crime rates at water sources over different days of the week and hours of the day. 

In summary, the findings included that:

* Most water sources are rural in Maji Ndogo.
* 43% of the people in Maji Ndogo are using shared taps. 2000 people often share one tap.
* 31% of our population has water infrastructure in their homes but within that group 45% face non-functional systems due to issues with pipes, pumps, and reservoirs. Towns like Amina, the rural parts of Amanzi, and a couple of towns across Akatsi and Hawassa have broken infrastructure.
* 18% of the people are using wells, but within that, only 28% are clean. These are mostly in Hawassa, Kilimani and Akatsi.
* The citizens often face long wait times for water, averaging more than 120 minutes:
  * Queues are very long on Saturdays.
  * Queues are longer in the mornings and evenings.
  * Wednesdays and Sundays have the shortest queues
    
The findings provided a clear picture of the current situation and helped understand areas of improvement to resolve the water crisis in Maji Ndogo. 

Sidenote: it was interesting determining fraudulent activities among some of our employees and discovering other unexpected insights.
